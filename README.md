# Code for BACH Segmentation Challenge for ICIAR 2018
Project in the context of a practical course from my masters called Machine Learning for Medical Imaging. The project was
conducted in a team of two over the course of 4 months, with a fellow student, Omar Shouman.

The model was not submitted, as the timing of the course did not allow it, however we reached a classification accuracy of **86.25%** on the a testing set of 80 images out of 400. The approach we used to achieve said result

The first and second place of the challenge got a score of **87%**. However it has to be mentioned 
that we did not have access to the official testing set.

The official site of the challenge can be found [here](https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/Home/).
